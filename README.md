# Word-Guess-Game

In this project, I created a standard hangman game with the theme of 90's video games. This project illustrates my growing abilities with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

To start the game, the user will press any key on the keyboard to begin. A game will be then be randomly generated and the number of letters in the video game will appear as _'s. The user will then attempt to guess the name of the game, one letter at a time. After 6 incorrect guesses, the name of the game will appear and the number of losses will increase by 1. If the user successfully guesses the game, the number of wins will increase by 1.

After a win or loss, the user can then press any key to randomly select a new game name and the game loop continues.
